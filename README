To run our code, following requirements.txt file to setup the enviroment.

1. Download dataset

Execute file dataset/download_video.sh to download the dataset that contains 7200 UGC videos. The total data size is ~35GB, thus it might take up to a day to download all the videos.

$ cd dataset
$ bash download_video.sh

Divide the download videos into dataset/train folder and dataset/test folder sets using information in train_label.csv and test_label.csv 

2. Feature extraction
To extract features from the videos, run the following command from the terminal.

$ python3 feature_extractor.py

3. Training
To train our model, run the following command from the terminal.

$ python3 train.py

The trained model will be saved to pretrained/model.pkl

4. Testing

Prepare a folder containing test videos, then run the following command.

$ python3 prediction.py /path/to/test/folder


Prediction results will be saved to a file named 'test_result.csv' in the current folder.
